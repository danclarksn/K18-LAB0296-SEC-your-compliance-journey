# Profile Types, Profiles, and Risks

## Goal

This lab explains how to create a Profile Type and assign a Risk Framework to assess compliance requirements for a profile. A profile -- *An entity we need to check for compliance requirements ---* will then have the associated policy and policy statements you just created. You add risks to the Profile Type and see what could be the potential impact of noncompliance to a profile.

## Profile Type, Profile, and Risk Framework

1. Click the history icon to return to the Policy Record. (as in Lab 2.0)

1. Scroll to related lists and then, in the Policy record, click **Profile Types** (1).

1. Under **Profile Types**, click **Edit** (2).  

1. In the left-hand selection list, click **Organizations** (3), move it into the right-hand selection list, and then click **Save** (4).  
    ![Profile Type](./media/image38.png)

    You return to the policy record. 

1. Scroll down to the **Profile Types** related list and click **Organizations**.

    The **Profile Type** record opens in a new window. A profile, **ACME Inc**., is assigned to this Profile Type.  

    ![Profile](./media/image39.png)  

    The **Policies** and **Policy Statements** created in earlier steps appear in the related list.

1. Return to the Dashboard and check the **Compliance Overview**.   
    The **GDPR Compliance** gauge is created with an empty status.

    ![GDPR Compliance](./media/image40.png)
    
1. Add a **Risk Framework** to the **Profile Types** as shown below. 

    ![Risk Framework](./media/image41.png)
    
1. Add a **Corporate Risks** to the Profile Type and then click **Save**.   
    Corporate risks are related to the regulation requirements. The Risk Framework is now assigned to the Profile Type.
    
1. Reload the form.  
    The **Risk Statements** are also automatically added to that **Profile Type**.  
    
1. Click **Risk Statements** to see the assigned **Risk Statements**.   
     You should have some **Risk Statements (6)**, including **Non-compliance with Law/ Regulations**. We will revisit this **Risk Statement** later.
        ![Risk Framework on Profile Type](./media/image42.png)

1. Under related lists, return to **Profiles**, and then click the profile **ACME Inc**.

    ![Profile](./media/image43.png)

    The Profile window contains **Organizations** in the **Profile Types** related list.

1. Click the **Controls** tab next to **Profile Types**.   
    There are nine controls allocated to this **Profile** as requirements described in the policy.
    
    To see the assigned Risks, click **Risks**.

    ![Controls](./media/image44.png)    

1. Click the **Non-compliance with Law/ Regulations** risk.   
    You are now in the **Risk** record.

1. Change the **Risk Life Cycle** status in the form from **none** to **Not Assessed**, and then save the record.

    ![Not Assessed](./media/image45.png)
    
1. Review all the fields in this risk record.  
    a. Scroll down and click the **Scoring** tab.  
    b. Check your inherent, residual, and calculated scores. 
    c. Write down the Calculated scores! (ALE = Annual Loss Expectancy)

    ![Non-Compliance](./media/image46.png)  

    Without having any controls implemented to reduce this risk, the likelihood to incur this risk, and in turn the impact, is high. The objective we want to achieve is to reduce the risk.  
    
 1. Change the **Scoring** record for **Inherent and Residual impact & Likelihood** as follows:

    ![Scoring](./media/image47.png)

1. **Save** the record, and then **Reload** the risk record form to see the new values.

1. Add controls to associate GDPR requirements to the risk.

    a. Scroll down to related lists, click **Controls**, and then click **Add**.   

    A new window opens allowing you to select controls to associate with the risk.

    b. Select **All controls** and then click **Add Relationship**.  

    ![Add Relationship](./media/image48.png)  
    
    There are nine controls associated to that risk.  

    ![Risk Controls](./media/image49.png)
    
1. After adding these controls, save the record.  
    The risk score remains the same since you have not yet executed controls.

    ![Scoring](./media/image50.png)

# Attestations

## Goal

As you have prepared everything to test the compliance and risk states in previous labs, let start executing. This lab explains how to generate
attestations for Data Protection requirements described in the Policy for the ACME Inc. Depending on attestations responses, controls status changes from draft to compliant or noncompliant, and has an effect on risk scoring (the more non-compliant controls, the higher the risk!).

1. Return to your **Profile**.

    ![Profile](./media/image51.png)

1. Click **ACME Inc**.  
    The current state of all controls should be in **Draft**. 

1. Click **Generate DPIAs** (Data Protection Impact Assessments, requirement from §35 EU GDPR).  
    The Controls now shows changes to **Attest**.

    ![Profile](./media/image52.png)    

    There are nine **attestations** created. Certainly, with ServiceNow GRC application, you can also create just one attestation by different category or different attestations by different categories for different stakeholders!

    ![Attestations](./media/image53.png)

1. In the Filter Navigator, search for, and then click, **My Attestations**.

    ![My Attestations](./media/image54.png)

1. Expand the **Profile ACME Inc** profile to see the full record.   
    You should now have nine attestations in the **Ready to Take** state.

1. Take one **attestation** (1,2,and 3) and submit it. If asked to attach evidence, attach any (small size) file from your laptop.  
    You can also provide multiple attachments for the evidence.

    ![Evidence](./media/image55.png)

1. Go back to the **Acme Inc. Profile** (2) and then click **Controls** (3).

    ![Profile Controls](./media/image56.png)  

    Depending on your response to that attestation, you should see the control status as **Compliant** or **Noncompliant.** 

1. Return to the Dashboard (**Compliance Overview**) and then refresh your browser.

    ![Compliance Overview](./media/image57.png)

1. Note the **GDPR Compliance** status.

1. On the **GDPR Compliance** gauge, click the green part of pie chart (or red for non-compliant).  
    There are additional citations related to that particular control in **Compliant**/**Non-compliant** status.

1. Return to the attestations and take remaining attestations. <!--this is not clear to me - what does take remaining attestations mean-->

    ![Remaining Attestions](./media/image58.png)
    ![Attestions](./media/image59.png)

1. Check the **Controls** status time-to-time and dashboards as in the previous steps (next example).

    ![Controls](./media/image60.png)
    
1. Check the **Compliance Overview** Dashboard.  
    Your dashboard might look different than what is shown below. You may need to refresh your browser window.

    ![Compliance Overview](./media/image61.png)

1. After having 2-3 noncompliant controls, check the risk status as described in following steps:

    a.  Go to **History** Icon
        (![History Icon](./media/image62.png)).  
    
    b. Select **Profile ACME Inc**.

    c. Under the Risks tab in related lists, select the **Non-Compliance with Laws/Regulations** risk.

    d. In the **Non-Compliance with Laws/Regulations** risk window, select **Scoring**.  

    There is a new score for the risk. Because of some noncompliant controls, **Calculated Score** is now higher. You may have a different score than shown below.

    ![Calculated Score](./media/image63.png)
    
1. After finishing all attestations, go back to the Dashboard to see the latest status of **GDPR Compliance**.   
    Your dashboard might be different than what is shown below.
    
    ![GDPR Compliance](./media/image67.png)

1. Go back to your risk - Non-compliance with Laws/Regulations; find it using the Your history icon.

    ![Risk](./media/image68.png)

1. Check the final risk **scoring**.

1. Click the **Monitoring** tab to see the control compliance metrics.

    ![Monitoring](./media/image69.png)

1. Scroll down and locate one of the noncompliant controls (if you have any) by clicking the **Controls** tab in the related list. 

1. Click the **Name** of a noncompliant control.

    ![Name controls](./media/image70.png)

1. In the related list, click the **Issues** tab.  
    An issue is automatically generated as a result of this noncompliant control. 
    
1. Open the issue record.  
    The record is in the **New** state in the Life Cycle (next example).  

    Under the **Details** tab, the reason appears in the **Description** box. Now, an assignee can start working on resolving the issue (not part of this lab).  
    
    ![Description Box](./media/image71.png)
    
You can also check out the **Task SLA** information under related lists on this form.
